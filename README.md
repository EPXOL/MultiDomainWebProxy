# MultiDomainWebProxy
This http proxy allows servers to host multiple domains on one port such as 80 without using nearly any compute power.

This repozitory includes whole C++ source code of the proxy. In builds folder you can find already compiled version for linux. 
You are free to edit the source code for your needs and maybe suggest changes so I can upload them to the official version.
